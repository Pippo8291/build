Subject: [PATCH] Prevent insertion in other users storage volumes

Don't allow file insertion in other users storage volumes.
This was already handled if DATA was explicitly set in content values,
but was allowed if DATA was generated based on other values like RELATIVE_PATH and DISPLAY_NAME.

Insertion of files in other users storage volumes can be used by malicious apps
to get access to other users files, since the same file would exist in both users MP databases
which would lead to MP falsely assuming that the user has access to this file.
